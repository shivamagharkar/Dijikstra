    "# Stage 2: ML Workflow (relevant for grading)\n",
    "\n",
    "The course introduces a set of ML practices and concepts. In the second stage of the assignment, students demonstrate their ability to apply these concepts to their chosen data set. The main goal is to use ML purposefully to solve the problem that the data represents.\n",
    "Groups are free to use the full arsenal of techniques introduced in the course. They can also make use of ML concepts not explicitly covered in the course (e.g., other ML algorithms) provided these fit the scope of the chosen classification problem. Creativity is welcome and has no limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverables:**\n",
    "Groups submit one Jupyter notebook. Please refrain from submiting multiple files. Spli�ng codes into multiple files and folders can be a good idea in principle but is not warranted for a small-scale project like this assignment. The specific channel for submission (via Moodle, by E-Mail, etc.) will be announced in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "The submission notebook should include all content students have produced while working on the assignment and demonstrate how they have used ML to solve the problem at hand. Specifically, the notebook will comprise:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  An introduction of the data set and the modeling task, together with a problem statement\n",
    "and motivation. Students are welcome to reuse materials from their stage 1 report for this\n",
    "part.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A section on explanatory data analysis including Python codes, the corresponding results,\n",
    "and an interpretation of these results. EDA findings could include but are not limited to:\n",
    "2a. hypotheses about dependencies between input variables and the target variable,\n",
    "2b. insights related to correlations among variables, which inform later modeling steps,\n",
    "2c. the distribution of selected variables and how this might aﬀect their subsequent use\n",
    "in an ML model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The training and tuning of at least two classification algorithms from the set of algorithms\n",
    "discussed in the course. In principle, you can use as many algorithms as you like but bear in\n",
    "mind the next bullet.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  A brief explanation of why the algorithms were chosen and why they might be a good fit for\n",
    "the problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. A comparison of the predictive performance of the employed algorithms using suitable\n",
    "instruments (confusion matrix, ROC analysis, etc.) as discussed in the course. The use of\n",
    "further diagnostic tools, not covered in the course, is allowed but not expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. A conclusion that summarizes the findings of the analysis and makes a recommendation as\n",
    "to which algorithm should be considered for the focal decision problem.\n",
    "Please understand the above bullet list as a guideline for what your notebook is expected to deliver.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are welcome to include additional parts, experiments, elements, etc. not explicitly mentioned\n",
    "above. Any activity somewhat related to ML that you undertake to solve the data problem can be\n",
    "included.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grading:**\n",
    "The evaluation of group performance is based on the Jupyter notebook submited in stage 2. Key\n",
    "performance criteria are:\n",
    "• Accuracy (25%)\n",
    "Does the notebook display competent use of ML to solve the problem? Are standard ML\n",
    "practices (e.g., for model validation) used correctly? Is the workflow statistically sound?\n",
    "• Scope (20%)\n",
    "Does the notebook cover all expected parts, as specified above? To which extent are these\n",
    "parts covered, is the solution comprehensive?\n",
    "• Balance (35 %)\n",
    "A notebook is a computational essay. It is good practice to ensure that your submission\n",
    "shows a healthy balance of text, codes, the results of codes (e.g., visualizations, measures of\n",
    "algorithm performance, etc.), and, importantly, a discussion of those results. Never produce\n",
    "a result without discussing/interpreting it. As a rule of thumb, whenever you are reluctant to\n",
    "spend a few words explaining some result, it is probably not worth showing the result in the\n",
    "first place. The group assignment provides an opportunity to show that you can code, apply\n",
    "ML methods, and fully understand what they do. By balancing verbal explanations, codes,\n",
    "code outputs, and their interpretation wisely, you can demonstrate these skills.\n",
    "• Quality of the exposition (15%)\n",
    "Are explanations readable and writen in good English? Is the argumentation sound,\n",
    "knowledgeable, and convincing?\n",
    "• Coding practices (5%)\n",
    "Is the code readable? Do you make sensible use of comments? Does the code execute\n",
    "without error?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each notebook is scored along the above criteria with a score of 1 and 5 implying poor and very good performance, respectively. Scores are then weighted using the percentage weights given above and added up. The resulting score is integrated with the scores from other evaluation criteria (e.g., class participation and exam).\n",
    "A word on academic honest. It is clear that you will use a variety of resources for your assignment. If in doubt, please ask what is a suitable way to credit a source. Here are policies for the most common use cases and sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Codes taken from question-answer forums (e.g., stackoverflow) do not need to be cited.\n",
    "• It is a given that you will make use of examples from the documentation of Python libraries;\n",
    "no citation needed.\n",
    "• Please cite blog posts or tutorials, which elaborate on codes/solutions that you (re-)use.\n",
    "Here is our policy for the use of generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT): You are free to use generative AI tools\n",
    "in your assignment. However, you must disclose the full chat protocol including your prompts and\n",
    "the AI’s responses. The submission should include this protocol as an appendix."
